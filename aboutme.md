Hi! I'm Khaled (KUH-led), a software engineer with a background in business analytics and data science. When I'm not deploying performant solutions to satisfy business needs, I am wireframing or designing my next project.

My philosophy on teamwork embodies agile methodology and CD/CI. Currently I'm working on deploying as many React Apps as possible, as well as improving my cloud-based tech skills. 

**Lambda Projects:**

- deployed a [deforestation dashboard](https://deforestationdashboard.netlify.com/map-view) that uses Python to predict and plot global deforestation. Mulitple linear regression in scikit-learn and geographic visualization using Folium.
- submitted my [capstone project](/capstone) for graduate school. Generated 5k+ randomized portfolios composed of the S&P 500's most bullish tech stocks in 2019. Preprocessed and normalized financial data to calculate an efficient frontier.
- built my [first web app](https://youtube-u.netlify.com/index.html) with a team of developers. Our idea was to learn and use YouTube's api to create a version of the streaming web app geared towards education. The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/youtube-u).

**Certifications:**
- AWS Cloud Practitioner
- AWS Solutions Architect (in progress) 
- Tableau Desktop Specialist
