Data Scientist with a background in banking and finance. Generally curious person and tinkerer of all things tech. My interests include deep learning and neural nets, machine learning, cloud computing -anything wrapped in Python. 

Recently I...

- collaborated on an anomally detection project involving international weapons deals, among other foreign military transactions. Details of the project and findings are the property of non-profit C4ADS - Detecting Diversion (signed non-disclosure).
- deployed a [deforestation dashboard](https://deforestationdashboard.netlify.com/map-view) that uses Python to predict and plot global deforestation. Mulitple linear regression in scikit-learn and geographic visualization using Folium.
- submitted my [capstone project](/capstone) for graduate school. Generated 5k+ randomized portfolios composed of the S&P 500's most bullish tech stocks in 2019. Preprocessed and normalized financial data to calculate an efficient frontier.
- built my [first web app](https://youtube-u.netlify.com/index.html) with a team of developers. Our idea was to learn and use YouTube's api to create a version of the streaming web app geared towards education. The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/youtube-u).
