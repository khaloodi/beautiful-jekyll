![me](/img/IMG_6321 (1).jpg)

Data Scientist with a background in banking and finance. Generally curious person and tinkerer of all things tech. My interests include deep learning and neural nets, machine learning, cloud computing -anything wrapped in Python. 

This past year I...

- collaborated on an anomally detection project involving international weapons deals, among other foreign military transactions. Details of the project and findings are the property of non-profit C4ADS - Detecting Diversion (signed non-disclosure).
- deployed a web app and [Deforestation Dashboard](https://deforestationdashboard.netlify.com/map-view) that uses Python to predict global deforastation for the next decade. Regression models generated and tested in scikit-learn, maps made using Folium.
- submitted my [capstone project](/capstone) for graduate school. It generates 5k+ randomized portfolios composed of the S&P 500's most bullish tech stocks in 2019. Preprocessed and normalized financial data, to calculate an efficient frontier.
