Data Scientist with a background in banking and finance. Generally curious person and tinkerer of all things tech. My interests include deep learning and neural nets, machine learning, cloud computing -anything wrapped in Python. 

This past year I...

- collaborated on an anomally detection project involved in international, weapons deals for a non-profit C4ADS - Detecting Diversion (signed non disclosure).
- deployed a web app called [Deforestation Dashboard](https://deforestationdashboard.netlify.com/map-view) that uses Python to analyze World Bank data. The app uses Folium to generate heatmaps for a linear regression model built in scikit-learn.
- submitted my [capstone project](/capstone) for graduate school. I generated 5k+ randomized portfolios composed of the most bullish tech stocks of the S&P 500 in 2019. Preprocessed and normalized financial data, to calculate efficient frontier.
