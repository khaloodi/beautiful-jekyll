title: Predicting The Functional Status of Pumps in Tanzania
subtitle: My First Kaggle Competition
---

Increasing population growth and urbanization pose serious pressure on the quantity and quality of available water. The sustainability of the present and future human life and environment depends mainly on proper water resources management.

To do this we can analyze the functional status of the available water points in Tanzania (in our case). Specifically I looked  into the dataset of water pumps in Tanzania to predict the operating condition of a water point. There are three categories that classify the functional status of water pumps: functional, non functional, and non functional needs repair.

To begin my analysis I started with a naive baseline measurement the majority classifier as a fast first approach.

As shown above, the naive baseline model purports an accuracy score of approximately 54%. Moving forward a train/validate split is used to not only improve the performance of the model but also avoid leaks.
