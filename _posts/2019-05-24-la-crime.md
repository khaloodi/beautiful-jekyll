Today I wrote and published my first Medium article ['Crime On the Rise?'](https://medium.com/@kadad1312/crime-on-the-rise-db58e753a2da). Give it a read and share your thoughts.

Crime happens across the globe and it fosters various consequences that may impact home prices or other neighborhood characteristics. Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks I seek to analyze California criminal records to gain further insight.

I practiced: 
- Pandas data wrangling and crosstabs
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas plotting
- Geographical plotting using Basemap

The entire notebook, including code and comments, can be found here [My Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Rd6dgE_iCZH19P91mGRTJo9ISfG1NwnE).
