As a learning experience, I recreated this data visualization from FiveThirtyEight's article, [Every Guest Jon Stewart Ever Had On ‘The Daily Show’](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-guest-jon-stewart-ever-had-on-the-daily-show/).

I learned about: 
- Exploratory vs Explanatory visualization
- Pandas data wrangling and crosstabs
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas plotting

The entire notebook, including code and comments, can be found here [My Colab Notebook]().
